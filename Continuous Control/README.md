# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Distributed Training

The Unity environment contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

This type of environment is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

### Solving the Environment

The agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 

### Getting Started
1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```

2. Clone the repository, and navigate to the `Continuous Control/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adebraine/RLND-Projects.git
cd RLND-Projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

4. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).

5. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
6. Place the file in the `Continuous Control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 
	
7. Start `Jupyter` and make sure that you are using the correct Kernel `drlnd`.
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Instructions

Run the `Continuous Control.ipynb` notebook top-to-bottom to train a Deep Q-Network agent and see the trained agent act in the virtual environemnt. 
- See `dqn_agent.py` for the agent source code.
